# Flash_Cards
This program is inspired by the flash cards every person makes when learning a new language. 
The app shows a word in French and in 3 seconds time, the word is revealed in French. If the "student"/player knows the word and clicks on the green check, the word gets deleted from the wordlist. 

The idea of the project is to show the features of the modules tkinter and pandas as well as the error handling sequence try/except/else/finally.
